## Code Explanation:

### `MainActivity`
The `MainActivity` class contains the entry point of the app, where the `BusinessCardCentered()` composable is called inside the `setContent` block. It applies a theme and provides a background container using `Surface`.

### `BusinessCardCentered`
This composable arranges the business card elements:
- **Profile image**: An image of the user (replace `R.drawable.android_logo` with your own logo).
- **Name and profession**: User's name and profession in styled `Text`.
- **Contact info**: Phone, social media handle, and email displayed with icons.

### `ContactInfoRow`
This composable takes an `icon` and `text` as input and displays the contact details in a row. It aligns the icon and text horizontally and applies padding to create spacing.

### Modifiers:
- `fillMaxSize()`: Ensures that the layout fills the entire screen.
- `background()`: Sets the background color for various elements.
- `padding()`: Adds space around elements.
- `border()`: Adds a border around the profile image.

## Customizations:
You can easily change the content, colors, and layout:
- **Replace the logo**: Use your own logo by replacing `R.drawable.android_logo`.
- **Modify text**: Edit the `text` fields to display your details.
- **Change colors**: Customize the colors in the `background()`, `textStyle()`, and other UI elements.
